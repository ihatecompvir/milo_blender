# Milo Blender Experiment

*Highly* experimental Blender 4.1.0 plugin for exporting Characters to a Milo scene. Currently only creates Rock Band 3-versioned Character milos. The idea in the future is to expand this so it can not only export, but also import Characters and also handle other things.

Doesn't support exporting textures or UVs and a placeholder texture will be used. Has some issues involving placement of bones. These will be solved in due time but if you have solved any of these problems or made some improvements please submit a PR, I would be happy to merge. Highly recommend messing around with this on Xenia, it will  likely crash the game frequently until I discover what limits the game has exactly and can check for those when exporting.

Please see the tooltips in the export window to see what the options do.

Would love for this to become a more collaborative effort. As I said previously, feel free to PR if you can improve upon my admittedly terrible code. This is basically my first Blender plugin, I cannot into Blender
